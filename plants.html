        Every other day you should use the bottle by the kitchen sink to water the plants. 
        There are many plants of varying sizes, but essentially the rule to follow is to hydrate 
        the soil well, but make sure there's no excess pooling above the soil line. There are 4 
        large pots on the floor by the rightmost kitchen window, those ones only really need to 
        be watered once a week.<br><br>
        These are general guidlines, but you don't need to rigidly stick to them. Plants are 
        organisms; every one of them is different. It's up to your discretion at the end of the day. 
        If a plant looks sad and you've been watering it once every other day, maybe water it once a 
        day until it perks up.
