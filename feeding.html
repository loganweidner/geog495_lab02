        The cats have automatic feeders, so you will not need to be there at their feeding times 
        of 6:00 am and 6:00 pm. The only thing you need to do is make sure the feeders are not 
        empty. This is not difficult, as the feeders have a small window that allows you to see 
        how much food is in them. If they are running low, you can top off their food useing the 
        bad of cat food in the kitchen closet.<br><br>
        If the cats yell at you, it's probably a false alarm. However they may need you to fill 
        up their water dish, and they'll tell you when it's empty. You can make sure it isn't empty
        by filling it up when you water the plants, that way you won't need to worry about it. <br><br>
        If they're still yelling, they may just want some attention. They're super happy to be petted 
        or even brushed with the furminator on the shelf next to the small plants. If all else fails you 
        can give them some treats. They're in the same closet as the food.
